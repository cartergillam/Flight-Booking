# Flight Search Booking System

A stripped-down repository showcasing an interactive web app where users can search flights, select seats, and manage bookings. This codebase is copied from a private group project repository and is provided here for demonstration purposes only. We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front end, Python (Flask) for the back end, and MongoDB for data storage. Our workflow included Figma design to HTML/CSS conversion, thorough testing (unit, integration, end-to-end), and code coverage analysis, all managed with Git/GitHub.

How to Run
Clone this repository, install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt), and ensure MongoDB is running.
Launch the Flask server (python app.py) and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Key Features
User Profiles: Register, log in, update profile details, view booking history.
Flight Search & Seat Selection: Choose trip type, see mock results, pick seats, and confirm bookings.
End-to-End Testing: Includes unit, integration, and E2E tests with coverage reports.
